    <h1>Tracey Radcliffe</h1>
    <h3>Aspiring Web Developer</br></br></h3>

    <h3>A little background</h3>
    <p>
      I grew up in a little town called Allyn, on the Olympic Penninsula. It is pretty much 2 coffee shops, 2 restaurants, a gas station, and your gone. Now I live on Capitol Hill, with my S.O. and a cat, Minerva.
    </br>
      I have a little brother, Skyler, and a newphew Silas that I am close with. I am close with my mother.
    </br>
      I love to read. Exploring new worlds within books is the closest I can get to my other passion, traveling, while I am here in Seattle. I travel as much and as often as I can. I try and travel locally, regionally, and internationaly every year. Travel teaches me something new each time I go someplace, whether it is a new custom or parts of a new langauge, I am constantly learning while getting myself out of my comfort zone.
